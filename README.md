## Wireframes 

For my wireframs I used Balsamiq. On reflection from PP1, I added to much detail. For this wireframe, I stripped it right back and put minimal design detail. 
I created wireframs to show what the page would look like on a mobile phone, and Ipad/tablet and a laptop/computer

## Design 

### Typography
For my font I chose 'Shadow Into Light' which I imported from Google Fonts. I added letter spacing to my font to make the smaller text easier to read.

### Colour Scheme

  As the colour of the cards are a mix of blue, red and white, I wanted to keep the surrounding area simple as not to over complicate it and ensure a positive user experience.
