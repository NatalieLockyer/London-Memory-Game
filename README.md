## Wireframes 

For my wireframs I used Balsamiq. On reflection from PP1, I added to much detail. For this wireframe, I concentrated on how I wanted the page to look on the different devices, but without adding too much detail which in PP1 was time consuming. Instead I used this time to concentrate on the CSS design when programming. I created wireframes to show what the page would look like on a mobile phone, an Ipad/tablet and a laptop/computer

</p>

## Design 

### Typography
For my font I chose 'Shadow Into Light' which I imported from Google Fonts. I added letter spacing to my font to make the smaller text easier to read. 

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/image-02.png">
</p>

### Colour Scheme

  As the colour of the cards are a mix of blue, red and white, I wanted to keep the surrounding area simple as not to over complicate it and ensure a positive user experience.

# Features

## Current Features

### Grid Game 
For the layout of this game I have used a 4x4 square grid which has a total of 16 cards. This is the maximum number of cards I wanted to use and felt anymore would look squashed on a smaller device. With the theme being London Landscapes, I chose to use the Union Jack as the back of the playing card. 

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/image-04.png"
</p>

### Game Information 
The 'timer' is on the left side, when the user has chosen their first two cards the timer will begin. 
The 'moves taken' is on the right side, when the user makes a selection and the cards do not match the moves taken counter will start to add up. When a matching pair is found the moves counter does not change.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/image-05.png"
</p>

### Navigation Buttons 
I have chosen to have two navigation buttons on the page. The 'how to play' button, when pressed will show a modal box with the instructions of how to play the game.
The 'reset current game' button, when pressed will allow the user to restart the game at any time they wish.

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/image-06.png">
<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/image-07.png">
</p>

### How to play Modal 
When the 'How to Play' button is clicked the modal will appear on the screen. To keep with the styling of the page, I have used a whitesmoke background colour with black text to make it stand out. There is an 'X' in the top right corner which allows the user to close the modal down and continue with the game. This modal can be clicked at any point throughtout the game if the user needs to re-visit it. 

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/image-08.png">
</p>

### Winning Modal 
When the user has correctly matched all of the cards, the 'Winning Modal' will appear on the screen. As before, this is in keeping with the style of the page and is the same design as the how to play modal. 
The user will see a message to congratulate them on finding all the matching cards. They will also see the total number of moves and the time it has taken them to complete the game. There is also a 'Play Again' on-click, which will restart the game if the user wants to play again. 

<p align="center">
<img src="./assets/images/readme-images/image-09.png">
</p>

## Future Features
In the future I would like to add the following features:

* I would like to add a username section
* I would like to add sounds when the user gets a match, and a sound when the winning modal appears.
* I would like to add a button so that the user can mute the sounds if they wish too.
* I would like to add a leader board were the users score would appear. 
* I would like the leaderboard to be open, so you can compete against other users. 

# Technologies Used

## Languages Used 
HTML - This was used to create the basics of the webpage
CSS - This was used to style and create the look of the webpage/game.
JavaScript - This was used to create the logic for the game and to manipulate the HTML and CSS on the page.

## Frameworks Used
* [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/) - This was used to create the wireframes for the initial development
* [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - I used this website to import the font-family (Shadow into Light) for the page.
* [Google Chrome Development Tools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/) - This was used to test the page on a variety of different sized devices. I also used this to try out different styles without the need to constantly change them live. 
* [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) - This was used to test the accessibility and speed of the page.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - This was used to create the initial respository.
* [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/workspaces) - This was used to develop the project
* [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/NatalieLockyer/London-Memory-Game/deployments) - This was used to deploy the site
* [Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) - This was used to check for any errors in my HTML and CSS code
* [Beautify Tool]() - This was used to 'beautify' my Javascript code

# Testing

  ## Validator Testing
  I used the W3C Validator to validate the HTML and CSS on my page. The results are as follows:

  * Index.html Page

  <p align="center">

  </p>

  * Style.css Page

  ## Lighthouse Testing
  I have performed the lighthouse Testing and got the following results:

  <img src="./assets/images/readme-images/image-12.png">
  </p>

  ## Problems Encountered 
  * When I initially added the timer, this would start as soon as the page loaded. To fix this, I added a function that would start the timer once the first two cards were clicked on. 

  * To create the modal I initially used a youtube tutorial. I followed this and it worked, however I thought it was over complicated and created a seperate JS page. I search on W3Schools and found a much easier, streamline way of creating this, as such, I deleted the old modal and created one based on the W3schools modal.

  * I was unable to get the timer to start when the first cards were clicked on. To fix this, I created a timer flag to check if the timer has started or not. I then created a function that starts the timer if the flag is set to false. I then modified the flipcard function to call the timer. 

  * When clicking on the timer container, the clock would start which wasnt what I wanted it to do. To fix this, I deleted the on.Click from the HTML which I added incorrectly. 

  * On the winning modal, I could not get the moves and time taken to appear. After speaking with my mentor, we discovered that there were a few errors in my code and a missing 'const' once I added that they appeared on the modal. 

  ## Responsiveness
  In order to fully test the responsiveness of my game, I performed the following testing on a number of different size devices, these were:

  ### Browsers
  * Google Chrome
  * Firefox
  * Safari 

  ### Devices
  * Redmi 10
  * Iphone 13 mini
  * Ipad
  * Samsung Tablet
  * Mac Laptop
